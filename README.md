# Rishika Randev's Mini Project 4 (GH Actions matrix) for IDS706

This repository demonstrates a GitHub Actions workflow which tests a basic Python script across multiple Python versions and Ubuntu versions. In order to accomplish this, a workflow yml file is set up with a GH Actions matrix build.

* A Makefile, which runs required installations, and then formats using Black, lints using Pylint, and tests the code using pytest.

* A requirements.txt file, which lists out some basic DevOps and Data Science packages pinned to specific versions for installation.

* A devcontainer folder.

* Github Actions workflows directory and yml file for CI/CD integration and a matrix build.

* A basic Python script main.py for creating a data visualization and generating descriptive statistics of a seaborn dataset on healthcare spending data across multiple countries and years.

* A testing script which tests the functions of the Python script main.py.
